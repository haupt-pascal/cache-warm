# üî• Cache Warming Service

A scalable, cloud-native cache warming solution for Varnish and Shopware, built with AdonisJS, Bun, and Nuxt, running on Kubernetes.

## üìã Overview

Cache Warming Service provides an enterprise-grade solution for warming Varnish and Shopware caches. By proactively visiting pages, scrolling through content, and monitoring cache effectiveness, our service ensures optimal performance for your e-commerce and web applications.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Intelligent Crawling**: Parses your sitemaps and prioritizes the most important pages
- **Real User Simulation**: Scrolls and interacts with pages like a real user
- **Cache Validation**: Verifies that your cache is actually working
- **Advanced Analytics**: Monitors performance and provides actionable insights
- **Auto-Scaling**: Handles any site size with Kubernetes-based auto-scaling
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Run cache warming on your schedule
- **Email Reporting**: Get comprehensive reports via email

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure with the following components:

- `packages/api`: AdonisJS backend API
- `packages/worker`: Bun-based cache warming worker
- `packages/dashboard`: Nuxt.js frontend
- `packages/shared`: Shared code and types
- `k8s`: Kubernetes configuration files
